In this we are going to see that how we can configure openSSL ie HTTPS on our local webserver

What is openSSL?
openSSL is general purpose cryptography library that provides an open source implementation of SSL(Secure Socket Layer) and TLS(Transport Layer Security)

Packages that we need to install before configuration.
httpd*, mod-ssl*

now the command that we are going to run is
[root@Desktop]# openssl req -x509 -days 365 newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/key.key -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/key.crt

Where:

req -x509 : 509 certificate signin request
days 365  : validity in days
newkey    : creation of new key 
rsa:2048  : encrypting with 2048 (you can use 3072, 4096 etc).
keyout    : for key
out       : for certificate
nodes     : to skip the option of securing certificate with paraphrase (to skip asking password again and again generally).

now time to configure the SSL on our local machine.

Step 1:
intall the packages:
[root@Desktop]# yum install httpd* mod-ssl*

Step 2:
start the services of apache server
[root@Desktop]# systemctl start httpd

Step 3:
run the command below
[root@Desktop]# openssl req -x509 -days 365 newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/key.key -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/key.crt

it will ask you for the details
likewise:
Country Name:
State Name:
Locality/City:
Organization Name:
Unit Name:
Common Name: **here you need to provide your website address**
Email: 

Step 4:
OpenSSL has been configured now time to edit the ssl.conf file

[root#@Desktop]# vi /etc/httpd/cond.d/ssl.conf
 
add the following details (provide your own website name instead this one is for example only)
<virtualhost *:443>
SSLEngine ON
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/key.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/key.key
ServerName www.mywebsite.local
DocumentRoot /web/
</virtualhost>

<Directory /web>
require all granted
</Directory>

Then save this file and exit the vi editor.
Step 5:
Add an index file on DocumentRoot directory and add IP Add & website name on host file
[root@Desktop]# touch /web/index.html
[root@Desktop]# echo "127.0.0.1 www.mywebsite.local" >> /etc/hosts

Step 6:
Now restart the apache services and browse the website on your favorite web-browser
[root@Desktop]# systemclt restart httpd
[root@Desktop]# firefox https://www.mywebsite.local

voila you have just successfully configured a fully flegde secure website.
