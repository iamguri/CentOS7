I hava made a script to make it quick, if you want to process it step by step then you can perform it without script.
All you need to do is to make changes according to your directory structure
Here i placed my index.html file in /web/dark/ directory you can change according to yours
I downloaded a free responsive website from  https://freebiesbug.com/code-stuff/html-website-templates/

Step 1:
[root@Desktop]# vi localwebserver

'''diff
- yum install httpd* |
---------------------
- systemctl start httpd
- systemctl enable httpd
+ echo "<virtualhost *:80>" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
+ echo "servername www.mywebsite.local" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
+ echo "documentroot /web/dark/" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
+ echo "</virtualhost>" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
+ echo "<directory /web/dark>" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
+ echo "require all granted" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
+ echo "</directory>" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
+ echo "127.0.0.1  www.mywebsite.local" >> /etc/hosts
! systemctl restart httpd
! setenforce 0
! firefox www.mywebsite.local
'''

Step 2:
Save the file using shit+: wq

step 3: 
Then run the script by using following command
[root@Desktop]# ./localwebserver

Note:
1. Don't forget to change the directory path on httpd.conf file
2. OS: CentOS7
3. Used Custom Documentation instead of default
