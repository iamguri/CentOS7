In this we are going to have a look at:
1. how to add user
2. how to grant particular permission to the user
3. and other various commands as well.


MariaDB [Library_db]> create user 'sarah'@'localhost' identified by '1234';
Note: Create any user with password using above command.

MariaDB [Library_db]> grant select on Student.*  to  'guri'@'localhost';
(Granting Select command permissions to user 'guri')

Note: To grant privileges on particular command we use “grant <on_particular_command> on <database_name>.* to ‘<username>’@’localhost’; “ 


MariaDB [Student] >show grants for ‘guri’@’localhost’;
Note: It will show all the grants options for the particular user.

MariaDB [Library_db]> exit

Now login into the mariadb using credentials
[root@Server ~]# mysql -u guri -p1234 -h localhost

MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;

MariaDB [(none)]> use Student;


# mysqladmin -u root password ‘123’;
Note: To set root password

# mysqladmin -u root -p123 password ‘1234’;
Note: To change root password. 

MariaDB [Student]> select user from mysql.user;
Note: To check the list of users.

MariaDB [Student]> select user,host from mysql.user;
Note: It will show list of users with their hostname.
